<h5>Terms of Service</h5>
<p>Owlverify is an data validation platform tool for validating transactional or promonational emails sent through your emailing system. The way it works is you upload your email list in the system it will call our realtime data validation APIs to validation your email address.</p>

<p>Owlverify comes in two forms—the managed service at <a href="https://owlverify.com">owlverify.com</a> and the open source version at <a href="https://github.com/owlverify/owlverify-frontend">github.com/owlverify/owlverify-frontend</a>. This terms covers use of the manage service. By visiting the website and using Owlverify as a managed service, you agree to be bound by this terms. You agree to indemnify and hold Owlverify harmless from and against any and all claims and expenses, including attorneys' fees, arising out of your use of the service.</p>

<p><strong>Accounts</strong></p>
<p>You are responsible for every activity that occur under your account either by you or users you’ve granted access to. It is therefore your responsibility to ensure your credentials are secure.</p>

<p>You may not use the Service for any illegal or unauthorised purpose. You must not, in the use of the Service, violate any laws in your jurisdiction (including but not limited to copyright or trademark laws).</p>

<p>You can delete your account anytime by accessing your profile page in the Owlverify dashboard. This will remove all associated data linked to your account.</p>

<p id="payment"><strong>Payment and Refunds</strong></p>
<p>You have 30 days free trial to test the service and be sure you want to pay. Once you are convinced and add your payment details, you will be charged on the last day of every month based on the number of validation consumed for the month as detailed in <a href="/#pricing">pricing</a>. You will be sent an invoice some hours earlier to remind you and let you know the expected charge. </p>

<p>You can cancel your subscription anytime. Once canceled, you will not be charged for that month and henceforth, but you can't validate your data too. You can always resubscribe to get start validating data again. If you resubscribe outside the month you cancelled, you will be charged for validation used in the month you cancelled. What this means is if for example you cancelled on May 20 (having used 5k events) and resubscribed July 3, you will immediately  be charged for the pending 5k events for May. (July’s charge comes on the last day of July).</p>
<p>Once cancelled, events for your validations will still be available for 30 days. This is so in case you change your mind. After that, they will be completely removed from the service. Your profile will still be available though. You can completely remove your account from your settings page on Owlverify.</p>
